                My name is caleb and I am a full stack
                developer. I have been working
               and have developed a keen eye for details. In my free
                time, I enjoy listening to music and watching movies, I have always had
                a love for music and find that it helps to relax and inspire me
                in my work.

                I initially started coding as a hobby, but quickly realized that
                it was something I was truly passionate about and decided to
                pursue a career change. It was a big decision, but I am excited
                to be able to do what I love and help others in the process.
